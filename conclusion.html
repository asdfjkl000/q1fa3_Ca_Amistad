            CONCLUSION OF THE STUDY
        </p>

        <p class="text-title2">
            "Does Being a Student Leader Affect Your Academic Performance?"
        </p>
        
        <p class="text-body">To conclude this study, we can now say that being a student leader affects your academic performance in a positive way. As we saw with the GWA data, the student leaders had
            above average DL qualifying GWAs. Even the lowest GWA which is 1.81 is still pretty high if you compare it to the average GWA of non-student leader students. We can say that
            the current student leaders of PSHS SMC and ADDU are competent and able to balance their student leader duties and their academic duties.<br><br>
            As for possible reasons why, one reason is that when you are a student leader you have to become a role model for your classmates and batchmates. It pushes you to become
            the best possible version of yourself so that your classmates and batchmates can have a person to look up to. Another reason why is that those who are so called “brave” and
            confident enough to run for student leader are those who believe in themselves and their skills because they are talented. If you believe in yourself and have the confidence you
            will put in the required effort to become a good student leader and a good student.<br><br>
            However, having good grades as a student leader doesn’t mean that being a student leader is easy. It just means that we elected the right leaders for the right job. We elected
            people who are exceptional, talented, and can skillfully balance being a leader and a student. Being a student leader is still very stressful and of course comes with a lot of
            responsibilities and duties especially the higher the position you go. There will be moments where being a student leader will make you face the lowest of lows and the most
            problematic of problems but I assure you (Coming from a Former President) that being a student leader is worth it.<br><br>
            Not just because you have power, but also because you can see your classmates, batchmates, and also yourself grow and develop over the school year. Last year, I got to see my
            classmates and friends in Kamia grow and not only be better students but also be better people and we celebrated that development with our farewell party. Those memories
            still bring tears to my eyes.
